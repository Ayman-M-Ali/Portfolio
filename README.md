This is a project that I completed as part of [Almdrasa.com](https://almdrasa.com/)
 coding challenge. The main goal of the project was to create a responsive website using HTML, CSS (BEM), Flexbox, CSS grid, SASS, JavaScript(modules, intersection observer API, Validation form and so on...).

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were utilized in this project:

•  HTML

## Project Overview

You will discover:

•  Tap to Top Button.

•  Getting news using API.

•  JavaScript Form Validation (high level).

•  Integrate the form in the website with Formspree API to receive requests from students.

•  View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript. You will also need to have a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your computer.

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The website should display correctly in the browser.
